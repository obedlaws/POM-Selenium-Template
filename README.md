# Page Object Model for Automation /w Selenium
## Templates/Examples so you can understand how it works


In my journey changing my career from video production into the tech
and development world, I was given the opportunity to become a 
QA Automation Engineer. So from that point onwards, i have decided to become
better and gain skills in QA and also more in automation.

So my first repository to add to my portfolio as a QA is creating examples
of POM for automated testing in Selenium.

I'm going to use a couple of different languages and you can decide which one
will be the best for you project. This is topic that after researching for a whole week
to get the job that i have now, I was able to find a series of videos that explained it
better that i could ever imagine.

So just to have something to comeback to and always remember my own POM structure in different
languages i have created this Github Repository.

## Languages
- [C#]()
- [Python]()
- [Javascipt]()
- [Java]()

### PSD
Even if the language you are looking for is not here you can get the concept of what is POM
and how it can benefit you creating you automation testing in you projects.

I have a Medium account where I post from time to time just to reference things and also
to practice loggin things as a developer and QA.
